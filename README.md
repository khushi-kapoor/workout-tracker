# React Workout Log

A simple workout log to keep track of your gainz! This is my first React app. It uses React, React-Router and Firebase. I used this project to get familiar with React and managing state without a state container like Redux. 

This workout log is geaered more towards strength training. For each workout, you can assign a date, add exercises (sets, reps and weight), and write notes about the workout.
